## Design Principles

<a name="single-responsibility-principle-srp"></a>
### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**
- **Explanation:** Each class or module has a single responsibility, such as handling commands, messages, errors, or configuration.
- **Application:** Breaking down functionality into separate classes or modules ensures that each one has a specific purpose, adhering to the SRP.

<a name="separation-of-concerns-soc"></a>
### 2. **Separation of Concerns (SoC):**
- **Explanation:** Dividing a system into distinct sections, where each section addresses a separate concern.
- **Application:** Each module (commands, messages, errors, configuration) focuses on a specific concern, adhering to the SoC principle. For example, the `CommandHandler` class handles only command-related concerns.

<a name="openclosed-principle-ocp"></a>
### 3. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):**
- **Explanation:** Modules are open for extension (new features can be added by creating new modules) but closed for modification (existing modules do not need to be modified).
- **Application:** By creating new modules for different functionalities (commands, messages, errors), you can extend the application without modifying existing modules, following the OCP.

<a name="dont-repeat-yourself-dry"></a>
### 4. **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):**
- **Explanation:** Avoiding code duplication and promoting code reuse.
- **Application:** By separating concerns into modules and reusing these modules where needed (e.g., importing `CommandHandler` and `MessageHandler`), the codebase avoids duplication, following the DRY principle.

<a name="documentation-and-comments"></a>
### 5. **Documentation and Comments:**
- **Explanation:** Clearly documenting code to make it understandable and maintainable.
- **Application:** Adding docstrings and comments to functions and classes ensures that the codebase is well-documented, making it easier for developers to understand and maintain the code.
